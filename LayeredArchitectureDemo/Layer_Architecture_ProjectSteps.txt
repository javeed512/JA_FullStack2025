Layered Architecture:
---------------------

Presentation/UI Layer:
main() 
It will accept inputs from End User
It will display outputs/errors to the End User
It will interact with Service Layer and calls services/methods from Service Layer


Service Layer:
Service Layer will have business logics/services
For service layer we always creates interfaces followed by implementation
In this we also write input validations logics.
We can also handle exceptions here
It wil interact with DAO Layer (Data Access Object Layer)


DAO Layer:
It consist of Backend Database code / JDBC Code
It will interact with Database directly.

Entity/Pojo classes will be used to transfer data between layers




Steps to develop any project:
-----------------------------
1. Create Database and tables
2. Create Java Project with packages 
   like entity,presentation,service,dao,exception
3.Entity class with private properties along with constructors/setters/getters/toString
4.Create Service interface in which declare methods and implement them in service implementation class
5.Create Dao interface in which declare methods and implement them in dao implementation class  (in dao crud operations with jdbc code should be writtern)
6. Custom Exceptions in exceptions package
7.  Unit Test Classes  in test package
