Maven is a build automation and project management tool, primarily used for Java projects, but also supporting other languages. It automates the build process, including dependency management, compilation, packaging, and testing. 

Here's a more detailed explanation: 
1. Build Automation: Maven automates the steps involved in building a project, from compiling source code to packaging it into distributable artifacts like JAR or WAR files. 

2. Project Management: Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file (pom.xml) to manage project information, dependencies, and build configurations. 

3. Dependency Management: Maven simplifies the process of managing project dependencies by allowing developers to specify dependencies in the POM file, and Maven automatically downloads and manages them.

4. Build Lifecycle: Maven defines a build lifecycle with predefined phases (like clean, compile, test, package, install, deploy) that are executed in a specific order to build and manage a project.

5. Use in various languages: While primarily associated with Java, Maven can also be used for projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. 

6. Hosted by Apache Software Foundation: The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project. 

7. Maven as an Expert:  The word "maven" itself can also refer to an expert or knowledgeable person in a particular field. 

In essence, Maven is a powerful tool that streamlines the development process by automating build tasks, managing dependencies, and organizing projects, making it easier for developers to manage and build complex projects.
